## About Me
I am a Junior studying Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics, while also pursuing a minor in Data Science at the University of Notre Dame. I have an especially strong interest in data projects cenetered around sports, specificially basketball. Outside of the classroom, I spend time working as a Team Manager for the Men's Basketball Team. Within some of the projects that are linked below, I have spent a lot of time exploring different machine learning models and also some other data management an visualization projects.
